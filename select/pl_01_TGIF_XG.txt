When I'm with my ladies
Oh the party don't stop
And we don't need no fire
Cause we already hot
Fresh so clean
Steal the scene
Drip pourin'
Cuz I'm a ten
I know yup
You know what
Too high up
To give a what
VVS's got nothing on me
Want it, got it, flaunt it
I am Queen
Pleased with blessings look at my body
Wake up look up in the mirror
TGIF

Thank God I'm Fly
Thank God I'm Fly

You call it cocky

I'm so Tahiti, hot and breezy
Off the heezy on the ig, yt, tt
Fresh to death my flyness blessed like heaven
sent me
God's my witness the drip's a technique
Ooh la la my ladies get ya moolah
Ooh la la my ladies never cool off
All across the globe and out the solar
Nobody comin' close when we show up
VVS's got nothing on me
Want it, got it, flaunt it
I am Queen
I'm lucky, I'm fresh
Look at me, I'm blessed
Wake up look up in the mirror
TGIF

And we don't need no fire
Cause we already hot
Yea I'm with my ladies
And the party don't stop
So we gon' bring that fire
Drop it like it's hot hot hot
Higher than the clouds

Sweeter than a chocolate peanut butter cup
Peanut butter cup
Gonna eat it up
Dayum
Thank God I'm Fly

Thank God I'm Fly
You call it cocky
